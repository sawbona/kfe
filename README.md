# kfe
This repository contains basic templates and all projects related to kfe (my personal open source projects).

Kfe is a very simple, but still, functional web project made with Java, Spring, Bootstrap, and Oracle Jet. Four of the most used technologies in the Java World.

In order to start with this project you will only need Netbeans 8.1 and cafe-template source code.

1. Download cafe-template Zip file to some location in your compute (let says ~/NetbeansProjects/).
1. Open Netbeans.
1. Go to File -> Open Project and navigate to ~/NetbeansProjects/k-fe/coffe template/cafe.parent
1. Right click on cafe.parent project -> Open Required Projects -> click on Open All Projects
1. Right click on cafe.parent project -> then click on Build... (if this is the first time you compile a maven project then go out and look for some coffee beverage). 
1. Once the build process has finished right click on cafe.web -> click on Run.

If everything went well a new tab should appear in you web browser running your web application.
