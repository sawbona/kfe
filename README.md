# kfe
This repository contains basic templates and all projects related to kfe (my personal open source projects).

Kfe is a very simple, yet, functional web project made with Java, Spring, Bootstrap, and Oracle Jet. Four of the most used technologies in the Java World.

In order to start with this project you will only need Netbeans 8.1 and cafe-template source code.

1. Download cafe-template Zip file to some location in your compute (let says ~/NetbeansProjects/).
1. Within Netbeans compile cafe.parent and run cafe.web projects.

If everything went well a new tab should appear in you web browser running your web application.
Complete the instalation by clicking on the --Installation-- link after that you should be able to create your first project and activity.
